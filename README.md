## About

If you've ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project, you will code a 
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors and play against the
computer.

## Learning Outcomes

A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs. Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the `Random` class, 
formatted strings and algorithms.

### Stage 1: [Unfair computer](https://hyperskill.org/projects/314/stages/1764/implement)

#### _Summary_

Before learning how to play the game properly, let's learn how to cheat! Using conditional statements, you'll write 
a program that always defeats the human player in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

#### _Description_

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a popular hand game. Two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with their hands, and 
then, depending on the shapes, one player winsâ€”rock beats scissors, paper wins over rock, scissors defeats paper. 
The game is well-known for fair win-conditions between equal options.

Write a program that reads input that states which option users have chosen. After this, your program must make 
users lose! That is, your program should always select an option that defeats the one picked by users. Once it finds 
this option, output the line `Sorry, but the computer chose <option>`, where `<option>` is the name of the option 
that the program's picked depending on the user's input. (i.e. if the user entered `rock`, the program should print 
`Sorry, but the computer chose paper` and so on.)


### Stage 2: [Equalizing chances](https://hyperskill.org/projects/314/stages/1765/implement)

#### _Summary_

Let's not mess with the player too much, though: from now on, we're going to play fair. You'll be able to do this 
with the help of the random module, while string formatting will assist you in announcing the result of the game.

### Stage 3: [Equalizing chances](https://hyperskill.org/projects/314/stages/1766/implement)

#### _Summary_

Can't stop, won't stop! A single game is never enough. Learn about loops in Java and apply them to make multiple 
game rounds possible.

### Stage 4: [Equalizing chances](https://hyperskill.org/projects/314/stages/1767/implement)

#### _Summary_

It's time to find out who the best Rock-Paper-Scissors player is. You are going to need the basics of file handling 
to read the records of the results of previous games, as well as tally the user's score in the current game.

### Stage 5: [Equalizing chances](https://hyperskill.org/projects/314/stages/1768/implement)

#### _Summary_

Let's raise the stakes, shall we? in the final stage of the project, your program will let the player choose what 
options will be used in the game and how many of them will be there. This will require some more advanced knowledge 
about lists in Java.
